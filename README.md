# _Doctor Lookup_

#### _A web app that helps a user find available doctors and more information about doctors in Portland area based on the medical issue they have. April 27, 2018_

#### By _**Semhar Kidane**_

## Description

_This web app will take user entered data such as name, location and their medical issue to give them a list of doctors API's with all the info they need about the doctor in Portland._


### User Story

| User Behavior | Input | Output |
|----|----|----|  
A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)
